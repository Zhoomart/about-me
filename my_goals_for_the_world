Everything below is my humble opinion.

Goals:
1. Life and conscious life is sustainable and protected from existential risks
- Climate change is reversed, and climate becomes sustainably stable
- Existential risks (e.g. AI safety) are properly and rationally dealt with

2. Economic and political systems that help every individual and humanity as a whole are adapted everywhere.
- Capitalism and democracy in most countries could be significantly improved.
- Social democracy in Sweden and Norway are good use cases to study.
- Systems should should make it easy for altruistic people from the global bottom to become smarter, more energetic and rise to the world's most powerful positions.
  Current systems often have wealthy corrupt families and groups of families in charge.
  Children born poor often have poor health, parenting, and schooling.
- Smartest and most altruistic people are more powerful than others.
  Currently a lot of power is gained based on inheritance or a capture of natural resource extraction. 
- Countries act rationally prioritizing long-term goals for themselves.
  Current democracies often time resort to solutions that are irrational for the long-term.
  
3. Global goals are prioritized rationally.
- Existential risks, long-term benefits and risks need to be prioritized rationally
- Countries and individuals cooperate altruistically and successfully to set and achieve global goals

4. Every individual acts rationally.
