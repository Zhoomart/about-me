DRAFT

There are thousands of areas where I am at a lower level than people around me.
I am creating this document in order to start capturing some of them.

Individual:
- forgetting medium value items (e.g. $50 water bottle) and high-value items (e.g. hearing aid)) in other people's buildings/rooms

Social:
- I make mistakes in all 3 languages I speak English, Russian, Kyrgyz
- struggling to balance between being speaking very positively about my achievements and being too self-boasting
- sometimes emailing people asking a question and not replying or replying too late
- pivoting certain % of discussion topics to myself or topics that mainly interest me without noticing
