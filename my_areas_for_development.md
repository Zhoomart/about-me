DRAFT

There are thousands of areas where I am at a lower level than people around me.
I am creating this document in order to start capturing some of them.
This document doesn't include thousands of things I want to improve even if I feel I am above average.

Levels are sorted from the more severe to less severe:

Level 1. ðŸ¤£


Individual:
- Memory: losing and forgetting physical objects (passport, hearing aid, water bottle) [trying to address it by checking items before leaving a place]
- Rational actions: delaying getting reimbursements (e.g. from health insurance)
- Reading: reading attention, speed, and volument [for now only addressing by listening to audiobooks]

Communication:
- English language: some grammar, some pronounciation, some punctuation


Level 2. ðŸ™„


Individual:
- Memory: losing and forgetting some small verbal promises [trying to address it by writing down promises, checking calendar for meeting agreements in advance]
- Sense of time: losing track of time trying to address this by extensively using digital reminders and alarms]
- Rational actions: sometimes wasting more than an hour on YouTube when I am tired [trying to address it by running and going to sleep]


Communication:
- Overall: struggling to balance between speaking very positively about my achievements and being too self-boasting
- Face-to-face conversations: can be thinking deeply about something and miss when a person is trying to talk to me
- Face-to-face conversations: unconsciously pivoting certain % of discussion topics to myself or topics that mainly interest me
- Face-to-face conversations: interrupting other people without noticing
- Digital communication: sometimes emailing people asking a question and not replying or replying too late
- Storytelling: telling compelling stories
